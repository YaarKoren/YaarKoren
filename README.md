<h2>👨‍💻 Software Development Projects</h2>

- <b>Unity Game </b>

   - [Match-3 Game](https://github.com/YaarKoren/BasicBitchMatch3) - A Match-3 puzzle game developed in a team of three during the Queen B Game Development Bootcamp.

  - [Battle Game](https://github.com/YaarKoren/Battle-Game) - 
     Multi-threaded tank battle simulator with plugin-based architecture, designed with two independent components: Game Manager and decision-making algorithm, and a Simulator for running and comparing them. The project was part of TAU course "Advanced Topics in Programming", emphasizing modularity, concurrency, and dynamic linking.
- <b>Data Structures (Java)</b>
  - [AVL Tree](https://github.com/YaarKoren/AVL-Tree)
  - [Fibonacci Heap](https://github.com/YaarKoren/Fibonacci-Heap)
- <b>Machine Learning Algorithm (Python, C, Python/C API)</b>
  - [Normalized Spectral Clustering Algorithm](https://github.com/YaarKoren/Normalized-Spectral-Clustering-Algorithm)

<h2>📑 Academic Papers </h2> 

   - [Metadata-Driven Hybrid Search for Enhanced TAU Online Tutor](https://github.com/YaarKoren/Metadata-Hybrid-Search-LLM-TAU-Tutor) - The paper presents an enhancement to TAU Online Tutor, an AI-powered educational assistant designed to support the university students, by integrating metadata based querying into a RAG framework. This was the final paper of TAU "Workshop On Applying LLM to Education", graded 97.

<h2>📒 Academic Course Notes (Personal Summaries) </h2> 
A collection of my personal, unofficial summaries for several Computer Science courses I enjoyed during my B.Sc. at Tel Aviv University.
These summaries were created for my own learning, but they ended up helping many classmates.
Written in Hebrew, my native language and the language the courses were taught in.
